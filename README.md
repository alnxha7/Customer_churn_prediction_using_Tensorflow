# Customer churn prediction using Tensorflow

Using the Bank Customer Data, we can develop a ML Prediction System which can predict if a customer will leave the Bank or not, In Finance this is known as Churning.
Such ML Systems can help Bank to take precautionary steps to ensure the customer stays with the Bank.

## objective
* Finding the % of Churn Customers and customers that keep in with the active services.
* Analysing the data in terms of various features responsible for customer Churn
* Finding a most suited machine learning model for correct classification of Churn and non churn customers.
